"""
You will implement the Eratostheneâ€™s method to find prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n, which is as follows:
- Create a list of numbers from 2 to n
- Mark all numbers that are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.
- Repeat the above step for every unmarked number in the list. (ie. you will check for 3, 5, 7, and so on right after this step)
- Unmarked numbers yield the primes.
