# Concepts
- Bubble Sort
    - Repeatedly swap the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, see [here]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)
- Insertion Sort
    - Virtually split the array into two; sorted and unsorted part. Pick values from the unsorted part and place at the correct position in the sorted part, see [here]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/)

# Teaching Tips
- Explain why sorting is important and exemplify on real life scenarios.
- Encourage the student to come up with ideas, start implementing his/hers ideas and improve their solutions on the way.
