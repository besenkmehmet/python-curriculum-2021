# Concepts
- Fast exponentiation
    - Fast exponentiation using bit manipulation, see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fast-exponention-using-bit-manipulation/)
    - Exponential squaring, see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exponential-squaring-fast-modulo-multiplication/)
- Prime Numbers
    - The sieve of Eratosthenes  : The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so.
        - If the student is interested and progressed well, you may talk about ways to improve the time complexity from O(n log(log(n))) to O(n). See the following [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-eratosthenes-0n-time-complexity/).


# Teaching Tips
- You may start by asking the student some exponentiation results, maybe in base 2 (since it's the most common) and lead them to find an optimized way.

If the student is interested, you may talk about another implementation using bit manipulation on power. See the explanation, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fast-exponention-using-bit-manipulation/).
