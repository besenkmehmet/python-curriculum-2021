# Concepts
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

# Teaching Tips
- Urge your student to start from and implement the first ideas that come to their mind and improve their solutions on the way.
- When transitioning from linear search to binary search:
    - brainstorm with the student so that (s)he can come near the idea.
    - make sure to comment on the complexity gain (linear to logarithmic) but also the sorting requirement.
    - brainstorm on real life scenarios where each search is more efficient.
