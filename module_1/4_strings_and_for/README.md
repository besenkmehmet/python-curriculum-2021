# Concepts

- String Manipulation
  - concatenation
  - lower-case / upper-case
  - iteration over characters
- Loops
  - for with range function
  - for (list, strings)

# Teaching Tips

- **How to get their attention for string manipulation?**
  It is crucial for the student to understand why string manipulation is important. You may give different examples from
  data science to creating websites to explain the importance of strings and manipulating them.

- **How to extend the for loop idea?**
  From lists and for loop, they know that you can iterate through lists using for loop. You can use the same idea for the
  iteration over characters of a string. Also, you can point out that for loop can be used to repeat some operations
  multiple times and introduce the 'range' function.

# Challenges

## EASY

### Challenge1:

Ask user to input a string and an index. Print the character at the given index to the console.

### Challenge2:

For the numbers up to 5, print the number, its square root, and number \* (number + 1) in the same line.

### Challenge3:

You are playing a game with 2 of your friends. Your first friend tell you a sentence secretly, and your second friend tries to guess a word from that sentence. You should let your second friend know if he/she finds a word.

## MEDIUM

### Challenge1:

Your little sister is doing her math homework that requires her to sum the digits in a given number for 3 different numbers. You don't have time to check all her answers; so you decide to come up with a code where she enters the number and you return the sum of digits inside.  
Ex: 198 -> (1 + 9 + 8) = 18

### Challenge2:

Ask the user to input a number ind tell if the number is prime or not.

### Challenge3:

Ask the user for a sentence to be converted to English letters. If there are any characters that are in Turkish alphabet and not in English aplhabet, you should convert them, e.g, ı -> i, ü -> u.

### Challenge4:

You are trying to write a sentence in reverse but it may be hard sometimes. Therefore, you decide to write a program that can reverse a sentence you enter!

### Challenge5:

You are trying to find if there is two consecutive letters that are the same in a given sentence. Ask for a sentence from the user and output the indices that are consecutive and contains the same letter.

## HARD

### Challenge1:

You own an ice-cream shop. The flavors are chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and cookie. Their prices are 4, 3, 3, and 2 $, respectively. When someone comes to your shop, you greet them first and you ask them how many scoops of ice cream they want. Later, you ask them the flavors one by one. When you finish asking, you should tell the total price they will pay.  
**Hint!** You can make use of lists and you can use _.index(elt)_ method to find the index of elt in a list.

### Challenge2:

Take an input string from the user and take two indices _i_ and _j_. Swap the characters of the string that are at the _i'th_ and _j'th_ indices. Print the new string to console with all lower-case letters.
