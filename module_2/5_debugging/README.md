# Teaching Tips
* **Explaining what is a programming bug.** Programming bugs are mistakes in the code that make the program do things different that what is expected. They do not always cause errors, therefore we need to find ways find the bugs that do not cause errors and remove them.
* **Some tips to debug the code**:
   * Check the code step by step.
   * Print the values of the variables to see how they change
   * Comment out some parts of the code to see how other specific parts work.
* **Practice Problems**. In `main.py` file, there are some examples of codes that have bugs in them and their corrected versions. Show the student each of the buggy codes and ask them to correct them.
